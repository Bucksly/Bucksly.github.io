## 2022

### Early Education

> From 2020 until the spring of 2022, I studied computer science at Lansing Community College.
>
> One Notable project during my time at LCC was designing a Breadth-First and Depth-First Node searching algorithm that would print the shortest path.

*The starting node "3" will perform a breadth-first (shown in maroon) and depth-first search (shown in orage) to find the shortest path to node "20" and print an image with their respective results*

## 2023

### Binary-Decimal-Hexadecimal Conversion Project

> After becoming frustrasted with constantly looking up conversions between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal values, I decided to design a converter between all three
>
> The program takes in a specified input with a decalered value (i.e. "0x" for hexadeciaml) then prints it's conversion into the other two types.

```yaml
# What the User inputs:
# Has a specific code to specify the type "0d" (decimal), "0b" (binary), "0x" (hexadecimal)
Enter your Number
0d10

# What the program outputs:
Dec = 10  
Bin = 1010
Hex = A   
```

### Later Education

> During the summer of 2023, I transfered to Michigan State University to further pursue a career in computer Science.
>
> MSU is where I am currently studying to continue my computer science education

## 2024

### Current Class 

> I am taking CSE 232, a class focused on both introducing C++ and a multitude of complex coding ideas along with it.
>
> The class has been a challenge but endearing and I have enjoyed the experience thus far.

### Emulation Project

> Besides the programming classes I am in, I have also taken an interest in other projects such as emulation.
>
> I am currently researching and learning about the process of coding an intel 8080 processor that can play games like "Space Invaders." This has proven difficult given the nature of old techniques, such as opcode usage, and general inexperience when it comes to game development.
>
> Here is an online resource I have used quite a bit as reference

# Programming

besides the C++ that I have to learn for educational purposes, I have also explored many other languages as well, such as;

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Python

Compared to C++, the amount of experience in all of these is quite small, but the experience I do have allows me to have a level of comfort and familiarity in these languages.
