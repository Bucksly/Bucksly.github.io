A list of other skills and interests I have garnered.

## Photo Editing

Besides technical allure of problem solving through programming, I have also taken an interest in many artitic ventures as well. The earliest of which is photo editing and graphic design.

Here is an example of an "image repair" that consists of starting with a watermarked image, and taking the steps to artificially remove it while repairing the damaged parts to be a close to real as possible

*This project was for practice purposes only and has never been used as a form of redistributing or offering an alternate obtainment method of the original image. (In the event this site ever is used for my own public purposes, this image would be replaced with a different image entirely)*

I also have paired these skills with photography to create a unique artwork involving pairs of shoes.

## Art

I have also dedicated a lot of time honing my artistic craft in with physical art. Both of these pieces were part of a final portfolio project for an art class.

This first one is simply a skull resting on a roman-style pillar, created using white charcoal on a black sheet of paper.

This second one is a portait of a woman, made using both charcoal and white charcoal on a neutral brown sheet of paper.
